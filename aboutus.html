                Our founder, Dato’ Chevy Beh, first came up with the idea for BookDoc after his good friend Wayne’s
                near-death experience
                with Dengue Fever. When Wayne first began to feel ill, he underwent blood testing at his doctor’s office
                and was sent
                home with negative results. His fever receded, leading him to believe that he was on the road to
                recovery, but three
                days later his condition suddenly took a turn for the worse. When he went to see his usual General
                Practitioner, Wayne
                was told that he had to go to the hospital immediately.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                While enduring the long wait at the hospital to be admitted, Wayne noticed that his gums started
                bleeding and he began to
                feel drastically ill. Panicked, Wayne gave Beh a call and luckily Beh was able to arrange for Wayne’s
                immediate admission.
                The attending physician mentioned that had Wayne been admitted any later, his life would have been at
                risk.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Inspired by his close friend’s near-death experience and being a seasoned player in the healthcare
                industry,
                Beh pledged to do something to address the inefficiencies and information asymmetries in healthcare. He
                founded
                BookDoc with the goal of improving the timeliness of diagnosis and helping patients to find appropriate
                care.
